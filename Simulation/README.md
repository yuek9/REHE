Simulation study source code for manuscript "REHE: Fast Variance Components Estimation for Linear Mixed Models".

*heritability* folder contains simulation code to reproduce the simulation results in the main paper; and also reproduces simulation results on matrix sparsification, simulation results on different reREHE summary functions, and simulation results on heritability in the supplementary note.

*NetGSA* folder contains simulation code to reproduce the simulation results on network-based pathway enrichment analysis in the supplementary note.
