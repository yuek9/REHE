# REHE
REHE: Fast Variance Components Estimation for Linear Mixed Models

Implement estimation of linear mixed model variance components via REHE, with functions written in R. 

For general use of REHE estimation, use scripts under directory *GENESIS_R*. Funciton inputs and outputs are made compatible with GENESIS v2.14.3.

For reproducing simulation results and data application results in the manuscript, use scripts under directory *Simulation*, and *data application*.

For generating plots used in the manuscript, please refer to files in the directory *plots*.

For questions of the scripts, please contact Kun Yue at yuek@uw.edu. For questions regarding the content of the manuscript, please contact Ali Shojaie at ashojaie@uw.edu.
